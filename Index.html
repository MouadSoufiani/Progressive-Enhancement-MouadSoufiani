<h2>The story</h2>
<blockquote class="Bigtekst">
<p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <q class="Villager"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,
    <q class="Farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
said, <q class="Villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="Farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>


The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The
neighbors then said, <q class="Villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="Bad"> bad </strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="Farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day the conscription
officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all
the neighbors came around and said, <q class="Villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="Farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>

The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether
anything that happens in it is <strong class="Good"> good </strong> or <strong class="Bad"> bad </strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="Good"> good </strong> fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p><strong class="Good"> Good </strong> and <strong class="Bad"> bad </strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="Good"> good </strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="Good"> good </strong> for bananas. Let's not
        make a big deal out of it... </p>
